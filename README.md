## Reflections
Zane- I struggled with getting the HUD to not cause errors. This was eventually fixed by redoing code from the tutorial. I also struggled with merging conflicts. This was fixed witht the bugfixes merge I learned how to make buttons, along with exporting variables in nodes, and my coding knowlwge in general has grown.
Sol- My refelction is that gettiing the timer working was hard but we fixed with help and double jump was pretty smooth just struggled only being able to jump twice but very fun project.
Devin- My reflection is that it was difficult handling some of the glitches in the game and what to use in some of the more specific aspects of the game, but through some trial and error worked out just fine.
Bobby- In my reflection of the project I got to have more experience of the godot platform which is new to me, I got to play around with the tile maps a lot but also got to program the sliding affect to give an ice affect. I also got to change the controls which showed me how to get more comfrotable with the platform. Doing this project again I feel like I could've made the level faster and made more code now that I have more knowledge of godot.
